			<ul class="indent">
				<li><b>General</b>
					<ul>
						<li>All work should have your name, the section identifier, assignment title, and the due date on it, and should be presented in a clean and legible manner.</li>
						<li>Graded assignments are due on the specified date in class. Late work is generally not accepted; if you have a good reason for being late, please contact me before the due date if possible. Also note that your lowest two participation activity scores will be dropped.</li>
						<!-- <li>If you can't make the listed office hours, please contact me to set up an appointment.</li> -->
						<li>I trust you to make decisions about phone/internet usage in class yourself; I only ask that it not be distracting to others. (This does mean silencing phones.)</li>
						<li>I prefer to be contacted through Canvas, but for urgent matters my email is <a href="mailto:mdurbin@uw.edu" target="_blank">mdurbin@uw.edu</a>.</li>
					</ul>
				<li><b>Attendance and Absences</b>
					<ul>
						<li>10% of your grade in ASTR 101 is for participation; up to <b>2</b> absences (for any reason) will not affect this. For each absence beyond 2, 5% of your participation grade (0.5% of your overall grade) will be deducted.</li>
						<li>You are responsible for all missed work, etc.</li>
					</ul>
				<li><b>Academic Honesty</b>
					<ul>
						<li>While group work is encouraged, <b>all work handed in should be in your own words</b>.</li>
						<li>Please consult the following resources for more information:
						<a href="http://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/WAC/478-120-020.html" target="_blank">UW Academic Honesty policy</a> & 
						<a href="https://depts.washington.edu/grading/pdf/AcademicResponsibility.pdf" target="_blank">Academic Responsibility Statement</a></li>
					</ul>
				<li><b>Ethics & Respect</b>
					<ul>
						<li><b>A welcoming classroom environment in which all students feel supported in their learning is very important to me.</b> Recognizing that you each bring insights and experiences to the classroom that are different from my own, I invite your feedback in whatever form you feel most comfortable (email, in person conversation, anonymous note). In particular, if I ever use an example/analogy or make a comment that feels isolating or derogatory to you, I would very much appreciate the opportunity to learn from you and improve my practice. Similarly, if you feel isolated or disrespected by a comment made by one of your classmates, or you see or hear something you believe I should know about, please don't hesitate to bring it to my attention.</li>
						<li>For more information, please consult the <a href="http://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/PO/EO31.html" target="_blank">UW nondiscrimination policy</a>.</li>
					</ul>
				<li><b>Accommodations for Disabilities</b>
					<ul>
						<li>If you have any kind of disability, whether apparent or non-apparent, learning, emotional, physical, or cognitive, and you need some accommodations or alternatives to section activities, please feel free to contact me to discuss reasonable accommodations for your access needs.</li>
					</ul>
				<li><b>Tl;dr you are responsible for your learning, and I am responsible for helping you. I can do that best if you are proactive about communicating with me.</b></li>
