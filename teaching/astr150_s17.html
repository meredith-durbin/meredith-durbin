        <ul class="indent">
            <li><b>General</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>All work should have your full name, the section identifier, assignment title, and the due date on it, and should be presented in a clean and legible manner.</li>
                    <li>Unless otherwise specified, assignments are due at the beginning of section a week after we start them; if I introduce an assignment on Wednesday, it will be due as you come in to class the following Wednesday.</li>
                    <li>Late work is generally not accepted. However, I understand that life happens, and if you have a good reason for being late please contact me <em>before</em> the due date if possible and we can work things out.</li>
                    <li>I trust you to make decisions about phone/internet usage in class yourself; I only ask that it not be distracting to others. (This does mean silencing phones.)</li>
                    <li>I prefer to be contacted <a href="https://canvas.uw.edu/conversations#filter=type=inbox" target="_blank">through Canvas</a>, but for urgent matters my email is <a href="mailto:mdurbin@uw.edu" target="_blank">mdurbin@uw.edu</a>.</li>
                </ul>
            <li><b>Attendance and Absences</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>I strongly encourage you to make attending section and lecture a priority. Absences do not impact your grade directly, but there is a lot of information that is only available in class. If you are absent, you are responsible for all missed work.</li>
                </ul>
            <li><b>Academic Honesty</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>While group work is encouraged, <b>all work handed in should be in your own words</b>.</li>
                    <li>Please consult the following resources for more information:

                </ul>
            <li><b>Ethics & Respect</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>A welcoming classroom environment in which all students feel supported in their learning is very important to me.</b> Recognizing that you each bring insights and experiences to the classroom that are different from my own, I invite your feedback in whatever form you feel most comfortable (email, in person conversation, anonymous note). In particular, if I ever use an example/analogy or make a comment that feels isolating or derogatory to you, I would very much appreciate the opportunity to learn from you and improve my practice. Similarly, if you feel isolated or disrespected by a comment made by one of your classmates, or you see or hear something you believe I should know about, please don't hesitate to bring it to my attention.</li>
                    <li>For more information, please consult the <a href="http://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/PO/EO31.html" target="_blank">UW nondiscrimination policy</a> and the UW Astronomy <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/astron/about/statement-on-harassment/" target="_blank">statement on harassment</a>.</li>
                </ul>
            <li><b>Accommodations for Disabilities</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you have any kind of disability, whether apparent or non-apparent, learning, emotional, physical, or cognitive, and you need some accommodations or alternatives to section activities, please feel free to contact me to discuss reasonable accommodations for your access needs.</li>
                </ul>
            <li><b>Tl;dr you are responsible for your learning, and I am responsible for helping you. I can do that best if you are proactive about communicating with me.</b></li>
