In particular, if I ever use an example/analogy or make a comment that feels isolating or derogatory to you, I would very much appreciate the opportunity to learn from you and improve my practice. Similarly, if you feel isolated or disrespected by a comment made by one of your classmates, or you see or hear something you believe I should know about, please don't hesitate to bring it to my attention.</li>
