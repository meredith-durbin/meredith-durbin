      <h6>A Recalibration of the Near-Infrared Tip of the Red Giant Branch</h6>
      <p>The tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) is a powerful distance indicator that will bridge the gap between local geometric parallaxes and the low-velocity Hubble flow in the JWST era. However, the slope and absolute magnitude of the TRGB has not been robustly calibrated in the near-infrared. To this end, I am reanalyzing a set of archival HST ACS/WFC + WFC3/IR imaging of 23 nearby dwarf and spiral galaxies to produce a calibration of the NIR TRGB across a range of metallicities, colors, and star-formation histories.</p>

        <h6>PHAT II: Triangulum Boogaloo</h6>
        <p>I am leading the data analysis for a large Hubble survey of the Triangulum galaxy, a follow-up to the <a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/phat/" target="_blank">PHAT</a> program, both of which have been led by my advisor Julianne Dalcanton. In addition to creating the full-frame mosaics and accompanying public release image shown here, I am running multiwavelength photometry and artificial star tests for the entire survey, which totals 472 exposures across six filters from the near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared.</p>

        <h6>Stellar Halos with WFIRST</h6>
        <p>The study of resolved stars in galaxy halos requires a combination of photometric depth, angular resolution, and wide-field coverage that WFIRST/WFI will be able to deliver like no other instrument. I work with Dr. Ben Williams and the <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/benw1/WFIRST/" target="_blank">WINGS</a> Science Investigation Team to quantify WFIRST's ability to accurately measure the star-formation histories of halo populations and recover their ages and metallicities, and thus to optimize future observing strategies. I presented a <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/~dlaw/WFIRST2020s/posters/durbin_wfirst.pdf" target="_blank">poster</a> with accompanying <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/wfirst-halo-notebooks/">Jupyter notebooks</a> on this at the <em>Astronomy in the 2020s: Synergies with WFIRST</em> meeting in June 2017.</p>

        <h6>Science, Technology, & Society</h6>
        <p>I am part of the third cohort of the University of Washington's <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/stsst/about.php" target="_blank">Science, Technology, and Society Studies Certificate Program</a>. I believe that an understanding of how STEM fields operate in relation to social power structures is a critical aspect of being a responsible scientist. I'm particularly interested in the epistemology of "big data", constructions of objectivity, and rhetorics of observation, exploration, and colonization in astronomy.</p>

    <div class="twelve columns">
        <p>Prior to entering graduate school, I worked at Space Telescope Science Institute as a Research and Instrument Analyst, where I worked on the HST/WFC3-IR instrument (see WFC3 ISRs <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/hst/wfc3/documents/ISRs/WFC3-2015-06.pdf" target="_blank">2015-06</a> and <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/hst/wfc3/documents/ISRs/WFC3-2015-01.pdf" target="_blank">2015-01</a>), built an internal web interface to access all WFC3 in-flight data and view ongoing monitoring results, and performed several error characterization tests for the <a href="http://arcoiris.ucolick.org/candels/index.html" target="_blank">CANDELS</a> survey. As an undergraduate at Pomona College I interned at Carnegie Observatories, where I studied the mid-infrared period-luminosity relations of RR Lyrae variables in &omega; Centauri.
