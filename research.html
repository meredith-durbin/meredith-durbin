      <h6>A Recalibration of the Near-Infrared Tip of the Red Giant Branch</h6>
      <p>The tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) is a powerful distance indicator that will bridge the gap between local geometric parallaxes and the low-velocity Hubble flow in the JWST era. However, the slope and absolute magnitude of the TRGB has not been robustly calibrated in the near-infrared. To this end, I am reanalyzing a set of archival HST ACS/WFC and WFC3/IR imaging of 23 nearby dwarf and spiral galaxies to produce a calibration of the TRGB across a range of metallicities, colors, and star-formation histories.</p>

        <h6>Emission Line Stars in M31</h6>
        <p>There are many types of stars that have emission line components to their spectra, in addition to blackbody and absorption components. Unfortunately, a thorough understanding of the physics that drives these systems is hampered by small sample sizes and heterogeneous datasets. I'm working with Dr. Julianne Dalcanton using narrow-band HST imaging (proposal <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/get-proposal-info?id=13857" target="_blank">GO-13857</a>) in conjunction with six-filter PHAT photometry to identify and characterize populations of stars such as Be stars, symbiotic stars, RHeB, and AGB stars that exhibit anomalous H&alpha; emission.</p>

        <h6>Stellar Halos with WFIRST</h6>
        <p>The study of resolved stars in galaxy halos requires a combination of photometric depth, angular resolution, and wide-field coverage that WFIRST/WFI will be able to deliver like no other instrument. I work with Dr. Ben Williams and the <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/benw1/WFIRST/" target="_blank">WINGS</a> Science Investigation Team to quantify WFIRST's ability to accurately measure the star-formation histories of halo populations and recover their ages and metallicities, and thus to optimize future observing strategies. I presented a <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/~dlaw/WFIRST2020s/posters/durbin_wfirst.pdf" target="_blank">poster</a> with accompanying <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/wfirst-halo-notebooks/">Jupyter notebooks</a> on this at the <em>Astronomy in the 2020s: Synergies with WFIRST</em> meeting in June 2017.</p>

        <h6>Science, Technology, & Society</h6>
        <p>I am part of the third cohort of the University of Washington's <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/stsst/about.php" target="_blank">Science, Technology, and Society Studies Certificate Program</a>. I believe that an understanding of how STEM fields operate in relation to social power structures is a critical aspect of being a responsible scientist. I'm particularly interested in the epistemology of "big data", constructions of objectivity, and rhetorics of observation, exploration, and colonization in astronomy.</p>
