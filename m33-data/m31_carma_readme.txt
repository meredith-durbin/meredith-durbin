---Brief Description---
CARMA+IRAM30m 12CO(1-0) data from "The CARMA Survey of Andromeda" (Schruba et al, to be submitted). The data have the following properties: beam size = 5.5arcsec ~ 20parsec; channel width = 2.5km/s; rms noise = 175mK; field of view = 365arcmin^2 ~ 87kpc^2; units: Kelvin or Kelvin*km/s [Tmb]; spatial coordinate system: J2000; spectral coordinate system: LSRK.


---Files----
There are two tarballs including line integrated (2D) maps, they differ in which sight lines and velocity ranges in the data cube have been included when collapsing the spectral axis. "sigmask" files have emission identified using signal-to-noise cuts (they have better S/N but miss faint emission), "velmask" files have emission identified using wide velocity windows (they should be flux complete but have lower S/N).

---Terms of Use---
The data have not been published yet and for now shall not be shared outside the M31+M33 collaboration. This restriction will be waived once the data paper (Schruba et al, to be submitted) has been published (expected for fall 2018).

If you are interested in using the data for any science project, please contact me first.
