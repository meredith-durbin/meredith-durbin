			<p>When I'm not doing astronomy, I enjoy singing, swing dancing, theatre, and opera. I acted in plays and musicals throughout middle and high school, and still love to perform when I get the chance.</p>
			<p>I am bisexual and am heavily invested in making STEM a more queer-friendly environment.</p>
