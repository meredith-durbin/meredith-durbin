<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I'm currently a fourth year astrophysics major at Pomona College. My thesis work is with <a href="http://obs.carnegiescience.edu/">Carnegie Observatories</a> on the mid-infrared period-luminosity relation for RR Lyrae variable stars. I'm hoping to work for a few years before looking into pursuing an astrophysics PhD.</p>
<p>I'm particularly interested in the intersections of science and the humanities, from the sociology of science to science media & communication. As a lifelong science fiction enthusiast, I love the capacity of the genre to examine the social repercussions of scientific & technological innovation, and often think about how popular science fiction influences public perceptions of science and scientists. I'm also interested in the causes of the continuing gender & racial gaps in STEM fields, particularly the cultural and pedagogical factors that affect people of color and women's interest in pursuing STEM careers.</p>
<p>I am co-founder of ALPhA ("Awesome Ladies in Physics and Astronomy") along with two other women in my physics class, and have previously mentored for the Claremont Colleges Queer/Questioning/Allied Mentor Program.</p>
<p>When not working on my thesis, I can be found playing with Photoshop, puttering in Python, and pondering pictures of Pallas's cats. (Seriously, have you <a href="http://www.arkinspace.com/2011/04/manul-cat-that-time-forgot.html">seen them</a>? They are magnificent spheres of fluff and rage.)</p>
