  abstract = {This article introduces the concept of the sociotechnical projectory to explore the importance of future-oriented discourse in technical practice. It examines the case of two flagship NASA missions that, since the 1960s, have been continually proposed and deferred. Despite the missions never being flown, it argues that they produced powerful effects within the planetary science community as assumed ``end-points'' to which all current technological, scientific, and community efforts are directed. It asserts that attention to the social construction of technological systems requires historical attention to how actors situate themselves with respect to a shared narrative of the future.},

  abstract = {We discuss how visions for the futures of humanity in space and SETI are intertwined, and are shaped by prior work in the fields and by science fiction. This appears in the language used in the fields, and in the sometimes implicit assumptions made in discussions of them. We give examples from articulations of the so-called Fermi Paradox, discussions of the settlement of the Solar System (in the near future) and the Galaxy (in the far future), and METI. We argue that science fiction, especially the campy variety, is a significant contributor to the "giggle factor" that hinders serious discussion and funding for SETI and Solar System settlement projects. We argue that humanity's long-term future in space will be shaped by our short-term visions for who goes there and how. Because of the way they entered the fields, we recommend avoiding the term "colony" and its cognates when discussing the settlement of space, as well as other terms with similar pedigrees. We offer examples of science fiction and other writing that broaden and challenge our visions of human futures in space and SETI. In an appendix, we use an analogy with the well-funded and relatively uncontroversial searches for the dark matter particle to argue that SETI's lack of funding in the national science portfolio is primarily a problem of perception, not inherent merit.},

This is partially due to the increasing acceptance of neoliberal capitalism within the United States\textemdash{}and much of the Global North\textemdash{}since the 1970s. Furthermore, NewSpace companies \textemdash{}which now possess multi-billion dollar contracts with governmental space agencies\textemdash{}are zealous adopters of neoliberal economics, and these philosophies are tied to colonial conceptions of the individual, limited governance, unchecked resource extraction, and frontier mentalities. These concepts became apparent during my multi-sited ethnographic investigations of NewSpace\textemdash{}as well as governmental\textemdash{}facilities and museums. This thesis argues that these hegemonic economic ontologies must be met with resistance from social scientists, science fiction authors, and the public in order to create a human future in outer space that is equitable, decolonized, and democratic.},

This paper aims to consider the law as it already applies to Mars colonisation by analysing the legal conditions relating to a human colony on Mars and the legal problems that will arise through long-term occupancy of the Red Planets surface. It follows work on the same topic (including space colonisation by space stations) that comprehensively examines the subject and is to be published (in French) by The Hague Academy for International Law in a book entitled 50 Years of Space Law - Space Law in 50 Years.}}},

  shorttitle = {Unfolding the {{Space Between Stars}}},
  abstract = {In this anthropological account of the ``interstellar'' \textendash{} the vast expanses of outer space between the stars \textendash{} I take interstellar travel as an object of ethnographic study. First, I examine three interstellar space projects: NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft; 100 Year Starship's manifesto on their quest to travel to another star; and SETI's search for life in the universe. Finally, I turn to corresponding examples of interstellar travel in speculative fiction.

In 2013, NASA announced a transmission from the Voyager 1 spacecraft as the ``sound of interstellar space'' and marked it as crossing a boundary into the ``space between stars.'' Organizations like 100 Year Starship and the Interstellar Message Composition program at SETI describe interstellar travel in terms of spacecraft, listening for signals, and active transmission. Fiction and science also co-render humans into interstellar scale via speculative technologies like artificial intelligence, instantaneous travel across the universe by ``folding space,'' and the ``generation ship,'' in which generations of crewmembers live and die during a multi-year voyage to another star.

This ethnography of interstellar ontologies across multiple sites and scales builds on feminist science studies (Haraway), recent work on abstractions as scientific things (Helmreich), and the concept of hyperobjects \textendash{} non-human entities that are massively distributed in time and space (Morton). As interstellar space moves between abstraction, text, place, and object, I find that it unfolds to reveal a constellation of potentially inhabited worlds inscribed by both scientists and speculative fiction; what was remote, insensate, and desolate becomes intimate, poetic, inhabited.},

  abstract = {The prioritization and improvement of ethics, planetary protection, and safety standards in the astro-sciences is the most critical priority as our scientific and exploratory capabilities progress, both within government agencies and the private sector. These priorities lie in the belief that every single science mission - crewed or non-crewed, ground-based or not - should heed strict ethical and safety standards starting at the very beginning of a mission. Given the inevitability of the private sector in influencing future crewed missions both in and beyond low-Earth orbit, it is essential to the science community to agree on universal standards of safety, mission assurance, planetary protection, and especially anti-colonization. These issues will impact all areas of space science. Examples that are particularly relevant to the Astro2020 Decadal Survey include but are not limited to: light pollution from satellites, the voices and rights of Native people when constructing telescopes on their lands, and the need to be cognizant of contamination when searching for and exploring habitable environments beyond Earth. Ultimately, moving international space law and domestic space policy from a reactive nature to a proactive one will ensure the future of space exploration is one that is safe, transparent, and anti-imperialist.},

In this article, I use the idea of the cargo cult as a way of thinking about contact with an advanced extraterrestrial civilization. The cargo cult idea represents a useful tool in thinking about how contact with a civilization from another planet might unfold, particularly if we assume that there is some level of commonality in the epistemological frameworks guiding thoughts and behaviors on both sides. I conclude that careful consideration of the cargo cult phenomenon suggests that from a policy perspective groups interested in active SETI should be cautious about both the construction and sending of interstellar messages and that from a moral perspective it may be prudent to refrain from active SETI for the time being. Given the fact that a variety of groups and individuals are undertaking active SETI projects, this is a topic that needs to enter the radar of government organizations.}}},

  shorttitle = {Space {{Sustainability}}},
  abstract = {{{The 21st century has seen a significant increase in space activity, driven by private sector entities using space for commercial enterprises. This increased use of space is not without cost to the delicate space environment. The threat posed by human-made debris in low Earth orbit (LEO) is now widely recognised as presenting a danger to current levels of space activity, and a more sustainable approach is sought by private and public sector actors. This article will evaluate sustainability in LEO and whether the consensus regarding orbital debris is matched by legislative or governmental action. More broadly, however, it will be contended that notions of space sustainability have largely been restricted to LEO. This article will seek to move the sustainability debate beyond LEO, by highlighting the potential risks to delicate space environments that arise from human activity in both exploring and settling other celestial bodies. The article will attempt to reframe the discussion on sustainability, advocating legal and policy solutions that need to guide future space activity to ensure that humanity avoids replicating the problems now found in LEO. \&lt;/ce:displayed- quote\&gt;\&lt;/ce:para\&gt;In recent times, the need for a sustainable approach to space activity has gained increasing recognition within the space community. One reason that awareness of space as a fragile environment has improved is the increase in major debris-creating incidents in LEO, most significantly the deliberate destruction by the Chinese authorities of their Feng Yun 1C weather satellite in January 2007 [4] and an unintentional collision, in February 2009, between the Iridium 33 commercial communications satellite and the defunct Russian Cosmos 2251 spacecraft [5].\&lt;/ce:para\&gt;While it is laudable that issues such as debris mitigation and removal are at last being taken seriously for LEO, and at least considered for higher orbits such as geostationary orbit (GEO), the current debate appears to have become limited to the Earth's immediate space environment. There appears to be little consideration of the long-term sustainability of activities and operations in the wider space environment, particularly regarding forthcoming Moon and Mars exploration [6]. Within the next decade or two, if current plans come to fruition, there will be teleoperated rovers, scientific bases and, perhaps, even space tourists on the Moon; meanwhile, space entrepreneur Elon Musk has announced plans to establish a colony on Mars [7].\&lt;/ce:para\&gt;The United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held in 1972 in Stockholm, is credited with bringing the concept of 'sustainable development' (of the terrestrial environment) to public attention, but the applicability of the concept to the space environment is still not broadly accepted in anything like the same way. Although the term 'sustainability' has become increasingly common in space policy discourse, its applicability has been focused on a limited part of the space environment- chiefly LEO [8].\&lt;/ce:para\&gt;This discussion will examine sustainability in LEO, where, despite the consensus that is emerging vis-{\`a}-vis the threat posed by orbital debris, there is little evidence of legislative or governmental action to ensure its broad applicability throughout the space environment. Having looked at where sustainability efforts are being concentrated, the inquiry will then attempt to move the debate beyond LEO, by highlighting some of the technical, legal and ethical issues that arise from human activity in both exploring and settling other celestial bodies. Finally, there will be analysis of some of the policy aspects and legal solutions that need to be established if humanity is to avoid replicating the environmentally harmful behaviours that have characterised operations in LEO.\&lt;/ce:para\&gt;}}},

  issn = {0038-6308, 1572-9672},
  abstract = {{{Scientists use the Earth as a tool for astrobiology by analyzing planetary field analogues (i.e. terrestrial samples and field sites that resemble planetary bodies in our Solar System). In addition, they expose the selected planetary field analogues in simulation chambers to conditions that mimic the ones of planets, moons and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) space conditions, as well as the chemistry occurring in interstellar and cometary ices. This paper reviews the ways the Earth is used by astrobiologists: (i) by conducting planetary field analogue studies to investigate extant life from extreme environments, its metabolisms, adaptation strategies and modern biosignatures; (ii) by conducting planetary field analogue studies to investigate extinct life from the oldest rocks on our planet and its biosignatures; (iii) by exposing terrestrial samples to simulated space or planetary environments and producing a sample analogue to investigate changes in minerals, biosignatures and microorganisms. The European Space Agency (ESA) created a topical team in 2011 to investigate recent activities using the Earth as a tool for astrobiology and to formulate recommendations and scientific needs to improve ground-based astrobiological research. Space is an important tool for astrobiology (see Horneck et al. in Astrobiology, 16:201-243, 2016; Cottin et al., 2017), but access to space is limited. Complementing research on Earth provides fast access, more replications and higher sample throughput. The major conclusions of the topical team and suggestions for the future include more scientifically qualified calls for field campaigns with planetary analogy, and a centralized point of contact at ESA or the EU for the organization of a survey of such expeditions. An improvement of the coordinated logistics, infrastructures and funding system supporting the combination of field work with planetary simulation investigations, as well as an optimization of the scientific return and data processing, data storage and data distribution is also needed. Finally, a coordinated EU or ESA education and outreach program would improve the participation of the public in the astrobiological activities.}}},

While Kardashev's classification (or Kardashev's scale) has often been seen as oversimplified, and multiple improvements, refinements, and alternatives to it have been suggested, it is still one of the major tools for serious theoretical investigation of SETI issues. During these 50+ years, several attempts at modifying or reforming the classification have been made; we review some of them here, together with presenting some of the scenarios which present difficulties to the standard version. Recent results in both theoretical and observational SETI studies, especially the \{{\^G} infrared survey (2014-2015), have persuasively shown that the emphasis on detectability inherent in Kardashev's classification obtains new significance and freshness. Several new movements and conceptual frameworks, such as the Dysonian SETI, tally extremely well with these developments. So, the apparent simplicity of the classification is highly deceptive: Kardashev's work offers a wealth of still insufficiently studied methodological and epistemological ramifications and it remains, in both letter and spirit, perhaps the worthiest legacy of the SETI ``founding fathers''.\vphantom\}}}},

  issn = {18753892},
  abstract = {{{Astrosociology factors relevant to success of future space exploration may best be identified through studies of sociological circumstances of past successful explorations, such as the Apollo-Lunar Missions. These studies benefit from access to primary records of the past programs. The Archives and Special Collections Division of the Salmon Library at the University of Alabama Huntsville (UAH) houses large collections of material from the early periods of the space age. The Huntsville campus of the University of Alabama System had its birth in the mid- 1950s at the time when the von Braun rocket team was relocated from Texas to Huntsville. The University, the City of Huntsville and the US Government rocket organizations developed in parallel over subsequent years. As a result, the University has a significant space heritage and focus. This is true not only for the engineering and science disciplines, but also for the social sciences. The life of the University spans the period when Huntsville government and industrial organizations were responsible for producing the rocket vehicles to first take mankind to the Moon. That endeavor was surely as significant sociologically as technologically. In the 1980s, Donald E. Tarter, conducted a series of video interviews with some leading members of the original von Braun team. Although the interviews ranged over many engineering subjects, they also recorded personal features of people involved in the Apollo lunar exploration program and the interactions between these people. Such knowledge was of course an objective. These interviews are now in the collections of the UAH Library Archives, along with extensive documentation from the same period. Under sponsorship of the Archives and the NASA-Marshall Retiree Association, the interview series was restarted in 2006 to obtain comparable oral-history interviews with more than fifty US born members of the rocket team from the 1960s. Again these video interviews are rich with insights into the people involved in the Apollo lunar exploration program. A common thought in the original and recent interviews is that the 1960s rocket team was a unique assembly of people with leadership and modes of operation that has not been reproduced since. If mankind is again going to the Moon, Mars, an asteroid or elsewhere in the solar system, a similar assembly of people and sociological conditions may well be required.}}},

  abstract = {{{For a number of reasons, the construction of a single space colony represents a future social reality strongly likely to play itself out repeatedly as the twenty-first century advances. As early plans are considered, we must take into account that societies on Earth serve to carry out a variety of life functions and, in so doing, must meet the social needs of their citizens. While the proper engineering/construction of space habitats is necessary to ensure survivability of the inhabitants of a physical environment in space, it remains insufficient to ensure proper functioning of a social environment in space. This paper assumes that the physical environment is adequate to sustain life reliably (that is, to provide life support) and focuses instead on issues related to the sustainability of a society in space from primarily a sociological perspective. The astrosociological argument serving as a central theme here is that we must carefully consider research findings of Earth-based societies and their communities and apply the sociological lessons learned to the planning of space colonies. Moreover, the astrosociological perspective can serve to provide a formal mechanism for collaboration between social scientists and space scientists so that construction of a particular space colony proceeds based on the greatest level of understanding possible.}}},

Many believe that extended space travel (colonization) will do for the 21st century what aviation did for the 20th. Our current concerns including terrorism, hunger, disease, and problems of air quality, safe abundant water, poverty, and weather vagaries tend to overshadow long-term activities such as Space Colonization in the minds of many. Our leading ``think tanks'' such as the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and the Brookings Institute do not rate space travel high on lists of future beneficial undertakings even though many of the concerns listed above are prominently featured. It is the contention of this paper that Space Colonization will lead toward solutions to many of the emerging problems of our Earth, both technological and sociological. The breadth of the enterprise far exceeds the scope of our normal single-purpose missions and, therefore, its benefits will be greater.}}},

  abstract = {This essay is indebted to Mary Jo Nye's scholarship spanning the history and philosophy of the modern physical sciences, particularly her efforts to situate scientists within their social, political, and cultural contexts. Beginning in the second half of the twentieth century, members of the Hawai`i astronomy community found themselves grappling with opposition to new telescope projects stemming from the rise of environmental and indigenous rights movements. I argue that the debate over the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) can best be understood as an exemplar of ``neocolonialist science.'' For indigenous groups who object to science on sacred lands, science has effectively become an agent of colonization. As the TMT controversy illustrates, practicing neocolonialist science\textemdash{}even unknowingly\textemdash{}comes at a high cost for all parties involved. Although scientists are understandably reluctant to equate their professional activities with cultural annihilation, dismissing this unflattering neocolonialist image of modern science has both ethical and practical consequences: Native communities continue to report feeling victimized while scientists' efforts to expand their research programs suffer social, legal, and economic setbacks.This essay is part of a special issue entitled THE BONDS OF HISTORY edited by Anita Guerrini.},

I argue the discourse surrounding Active SETI or messaging to extraterrestrial intelligence (METI) has focused on the risks to human civilization without giving significant consideration to risks contact might represent for our potential interstellar interlocutors. There is the potential that METI could present a threat to an alien civilization or even a form of unintended cultural imperialism that has the potential to harm an extraterrestrial society. This issue needs to be considered by METI scientists before sending a message intended for an extraterrestrial civilization. Furthermore, it raises problems with the suggestion among some SETI scholars that we should send large amounts of content, such as the Google servers, to make it easier for an alien civilization to decode information in any message we send.},

  issn = {0306-3127, 1460-3659},
  abstract = {This paper addresses an intersection between postcolonial studies and science studies, examining the greater colonial context of space exploration. In response to Chakrabarty's call to `provincialize Europe', I ask what it might mean to `provincialize' outer space, considering locality relative to extra-planetary distance, and the asymmetries of history next to the symmetrical methodology advocated by Latour. By way of a brief reading of fictional texts that played an important role in the technical imagination leading up to spaceflight, I sketch the colonizing impulse that underwrote space exploration through and beyond the age of empire. I then turn to the French/European launch site at Kourou, French Guiana, where a sparsely populated former colony became a preferred launching ground for communication satellites into equatorial orbits. Here the representation of outer space as a final frontier crosses the remains of older colonial projects, uneasily confronting the landscape of their human legacy. In opposition to the space centre's focus on adventure, political focus within French Guiana stresses development and strives to confront the space project with the local legacy of colonial failure. A conflict over the closing of a stretch of road provides a situated moment to illustrate these contrasting understandings of the place of outer space. In this conflict, I suggest, the very length and orientation of the space centre's network affect the locality of its representation, revealing after-effects of earlier formations of geography and history. Thus, in resituating outer space against the ground, it remains important to distinguish between local knowledges and techniques that are more or less expansive, and keep in sight the different spatial and temporal frames within which `the local' takes shape.},

  abstract = {A hard difficulty in Astrobiology is the precise definition of what life is. All living beings have a cellular structure, so it is not possible to have a broader concept of life hence the search for extraterrestrial life is restricted to extraterrestrial cells. Earth is an astronomical rarity because it is difficult for a planet to present liquid water on the surface. Two antagonistic bioethical principles arise: planetary protection and terraforming. Planetary protection is based on the fear of interplanetary cross-infection and possible ecological damages caused by alien living beings. Terraforming is the intention of modifying the environmental conditions of the neighbouring planets in such a way that human colonisation would be possible. The synthesis of this antagonism is ecopoiesis, a concept related to the creation of new ecosystems in other planets. Since all the multicellular biodiversity requires oxygen to survive, only extremophile microorganisms could survive in other planets. So, it could be carried out a simulation of a meteorite by taking to other planets portions of the terrestrial permafrost, or ocean or soil, so that if a single species could grow, a new ecosystem would start, as well as a new Natural History. As a conclusion, ecopoiesis should be the bioethical principle to guide practices and research in Astrobiology.},

Habitability research of Earth, Mars, and exoplanets examines extreme cases relevant for understanding climate change as a planetary process. Energy-intensive civilizations will also face thermodynamic limits to growth, which provides an important constraint for estimating the longevity of human civilization and guiding the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.

  volume = {67},
  abstract = {{{Past patterns of exploration, colonization and exploitation on Earth continue to provide the predominant paradigms that guide many space programs. Any project of crewed space exploration, especially of the magnitude envisioned by the 100-Year Starship Study, must guard against the hubris that may emerge among planners, crew, and others associated with the project, including those industries and bureaucracies that will emerge from the effort. Maintaining a non-exploitative approach may be difficult in consideration of the century of preparatory research and development and the likely multigenerational nature of the voyage itself. Starting now with mission dreamers and planners, the purpose of the voyage must be cast as one of respectful learning and humble discovery, not of conquest (either actual or metaphorical) or other inappropriate models, including military. At a minimum, the Study must actively build non-violence into the voyaging culture it is beginning to create today. References to exploitive colonization, conquest, destiny and other terms from especially American frontier mythology, while tempting in their propagandizing power, should be avoided as they limit creative thinking about alternative possible futures. Future voyagers must strive to adapt to new environments wherever possible and be assimilated by new worlds both biologically and behaviorally rather than to rely on attempts to recreate the Earth they have left. Adaptation should be strongly considered over terraforming. This paper provides an overview of previous work linking the language of colonization to space programs and challenges the extension of the myth of the American frontier to the Starship Study. It argues that such metaphors would be counter-productive at best and have the potential to doom long-term success and survival by planting seeds of social decay and self-destruction. Cautions and recommendations are suggested.}}},

  abstract = {This article argues that research involving active SETI, or sending messages toward possible extraterrestrial intelligence (METI), is not ethically justifiable. As a way of working some of the ethical problems associated with METI, I approach the sending of a message from the perspective that it represents a research endeavor involving sentient beings and therefore, should undergo review by a university institutional review board (IRB). As such, METI should be expected to meet several criteria expected by IRBs as being necessary components of ethically justifiable research. By considering issues of proportionality, justice, informed consent, the likely success of obtaining desired results, and necessity and considering risks and benefits to research subjects, as well as the mandate to do no harm, it is evident that METI does not meet the requirements for ethical research on human subjects and, thus, should not be considered ethical when it comes to nonhuman sentient beings.},

This paper reflects on the challenges, opportunities, scenarios, and interventions involved as we try to queer the increasingly corporate and military human exploration of and engagement with outer space. I suggest that we must go further than academically interrogating the military and corporate narratives of space ``exploration'' and ``colonization.'' We must also water, fertilize, and tend the seeds of alternative visions of possible futures in space, not only seeking solutions to earthly problems of the moment, but actively queering outer space and challenging the future to be even more queer.},

Arguments in favor of METI are reviewed. It is concluded that METI is unwise, unscienti c, potentially catastrophic, and unethical.}}},
