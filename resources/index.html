            I maintain several collections of literature broadly related to STS, astronomy, and the intersection thereof. 
            These collections are all works in progress, and should not be taken as representative of anything other than my own journey through the literature. 
            While many of the readings listed take explicitly critical and/or decolonial positions, not all do. 
            In addition to critical works, I have made an effort to include works that are illustrative of mainstream views and narratives within astronomy.
